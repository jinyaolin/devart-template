## Description
We want to create a large interactive multitouch display by assemble many portable pads or mobiles. First, each kids would be asked to draw a man on a pad. And we would put them together and perform a stitch gesture to combine them into one big interactive screen. The draw men would start to dance with the music. With these portable pads we can bring the power of technology and art to the far far away place.
